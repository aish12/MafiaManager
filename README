Alpha Release:
  - This release is the skeleton of our project. What we have right now is what our app is going to look and feel like, 
    but most functionality has not yet been implemented.

  - Login/Register page and functionality
    - You can log in and register and it will authorize it/create that account like in HW6
  - Can also save user information/profile and retrieve it from the Firebase database
    - For example, the welcome loading page shows that user's name they signed up with.
    - In the future, this will be how we store the user's game data as well
  - Welcome Loading screen

  - Help / instructions
    - A simple TextView with information about the app's purpose, and instructions on the many features found in the app.
  - Constraints and UI clean up
    - Made everything *pretty* and consistent with sizing, margins, and contraints.
  - End game view (Narrator Only)
    - The end game result screens that appear when the game is over.
    - The Narrator should be able to select players in the table to indicate who are the 'winners' of the game. 
      - This is for bookkeeping purposes, and can be viewed in the 'History' tab.
      - The functionality has not been implemented yet, and appears blank for now.

  - Card and Deck creation views
    - Did views for browsing Decks, creating Decks, browsing cards, and creating cards.
    - Browsing uses a CollectionView for that grid look/feel.
    - Deck and Card creation skeleton implemented in Storyboard.

  - Game views and Dashboard
    - Added views for both the narrator and player setup. No functionality (promised for Beta), but layout and skeleton for
      selecting a deck, customizing number of characters, adding players, and joining a game.
    - Created narrator dashboard. At this point is an empty table with a button to end the game, a timer, and settings view
    - Timer view created, no functionality but uses a picker for up to 15min59sec.
  - Settings view	
    - Simple view with an option to mute the game, designate a default timer length, and log out of the game. Also includes
      a help segue to the instructions page

Differences:
 - In our proposal we had a slight contradiction, saying that we would work on the statistics page during Alpha, but also that stats/history is a stretch goal
   We decided to keep it as a stretch goal hopefully as part of the final release (as clarified in our design doc)
 - Removed the edit button in Deck Management, and replaced it with a 'Settings' button that should be accessible on all three tabs.

 
 
Clarifications:
 - While there is a log in functionality, there is no log out functionality because in our Proposal we stated that is part of our settings page functionality.
 - In our design doc, we forgot to include a section for game instructions. To account for this we put this as part of the settings 
 - A lot of the views won't look like much due to lack of data. 
   - Due to this, we have temporary buttons so you can access the views dependent on collection/table data.
