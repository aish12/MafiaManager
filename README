Beta Release:
  - This release has most of the functionality of our project. There are a few things that don't yet have functionality, and we will specify this in the Clarifications/Differences section.
  - The game is best seen on the iPhone XR (this is clarified in the Known Bugs section)
  
Testing Instructions:
 - It's best if you use two simulators to test the networking. At the start of the game, on simulator should be the narrator and the other should be the player. The narrator can follow the given directions and once it gets to the "Wait for Players" view, the narrator needs to wait for the players to connect. The player can then connect and a popup should show the devices that are available. The player should then select the narrator and the narrator can then press the "Start" button to begin the game.

Differences:
 - In our Design doc, we stated that the player would be able to pick which narrator to join from a table view, but with the MultipeerConnectivity library, it already gives us a popup to select which device to connect to. Therefore, when trying to connect to a narrator, the player can just select the device the narrator has.


Clarifications:
 - This wasn't clear in our proposal, but we have not implemented searching functionality. We will do so during the final release.
 - While it said in our proposal that we'd have the statistics functionality done for this release, we also specified in the Alpha release that because that is releated to our stretch goal (the History tab), we would include that with our final release. This should be shown when the narrator taps "Skip" or "Record Winners" at the very end of the game. For now, it just leads the narrator back to the initial view of the player tab (Start Game as Narrator and Join Game as Player options).
 - It was never specified in our proposal, but we have decided to save everything into Core Data for now, meaning each unique user doesn't have their own decks/cards/game. We were thinking for the final release, when the user logs in, they download their data and information onto their own device, using Core Data.
 - The most number of connections with the multipeer networking is 8 for this release. For the final release, we were thinking of possibily allowing it to handle more connections.


Known Bugs:
 - In the Decks and Cards tab, when you press and hold on a deck/card to delete it, it jiggles. If you continue to let it jiggle and then press the add deck/card cell, it will add the deck/card and the old decks/cards will jiggle and be deletable, EXCEPT for the one that you just added.
 - In the collection view for both Decks and Cards, there is a big gap between the decks/cards on smaller screens.
 - When you let the app close and reopen it, the app will automatically go to the welcome loading page and stay there. We should fix this to to the Decks tab.











Alpha Release:
  - This release is the skeleton of our project. What we have right now is what our app is going to look and feel like, 
    but most functionality has not yet been implemented.

  - Login/Register page and functionality
    - You can log in and register and it will authorize it/create that account like in HW6
  - Can also save user information/profile and retrieve it from the Firebase database
    - For example, the welcome loading page shows that user's name they signed up with.
    - In the future, this will be how we store the user's game data as well
  - Welcome Loading screen

  - Help / instructions
    - A simple TextView with information about the app's purpose, and instructions on the many features found in the app.
  - Constraints and UI clean up
    - Made everything *pretty* and consistent with sizing, margins, and contraints.
  - End game view (Narrator Only)
    - The end game result screens that appear when the game is over.
    - The Narrator should be able to select players in the table to indicate who are the 'winners' of the game. 
      - This is for bookkeeping purposes, and can be viewed in the 'History' tab.
      - The functionality has not been implemented yet, and appears blank for now.

  - Card and Deck creation views
    - Did views for browsing Decks, creating Decks, browsing cards, and creating cards.
    - Browsing uses a CollectionView for that grid look/feel.
    - Deck and Card creation skeleton implemented in Storyboard.

  - Game views and Dashboard
    - Added views for both the narrator and player setup. No functionality (promised for Beta), but layout and skeleton for
      selecting a deck, customizing number of characters, adding players, and joining a game.
    - Created narrator dashboard. At this point is an empty table with a button to end the game, a timer, and settings view
    - Timer view created, no functionality but uses a picker for up to 15min59sec.
  - Settings view	
    - Simple view with an option to mute the game, designate a default timer length, and log out of the game. Also includes
      a help segue to the instructions page

Differences:
 - In our proposal we had a slight contradiction, saying that we would work on the statistics page during Alpha, but also that stats/history is a stretch goal
   We decided to keep it as a stretch goal hopefully as part of the final release (as clarified in our design doc)
 - Removed the edit button in Deck Management, and replaced it with a 'Settings' button that should be accessible on all three tabs.

 
 
Clarifications:
 - While we have search bars built in, we did not fill out the functionality to dismiss them.
 - While there is a log in functionality, there is no log out functionality because in our Proposal we stated that is part of our settings page functionality.
 - In our design doc, we forgot to include a section for game instructions. To account for this we put this as part of the settings 
 - A lot of the views won't look like much due to lack of data. 
   - Due to this, we have temporary buttons so you can access the views dependent on collection/table data.
