  - Login/Register page and functionality
    - You can log in and register and it will authorize it/create that account like in HW6
  - Can also save user information/profile and retrieve it from the Firebase database
    - For example, the welcome loading page shows that user's name they signed up with.
    - In the future, this will be how we store the user's game data as well
  - Welcome Loading screen

Differences:
 - In our proposal we had a slight contradiction, saying that we would work on the statistics page during Alpha, but also that stats/history is a stretch goal
   We decided to keep it as a stretch goal hopefully as part of the final release (as clarified in our design doc)

 
 
Clarifications:
 - While there is a log in functionality, there is no log out functionality because in our Proposal we stated that is part of our settings page functionality.
 - In our design doc, we forgot to include a section for game instructions. To account for this we put this as part of the settings
