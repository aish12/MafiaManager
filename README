  - Login/Register page and functionality
    - You can log in and register and it will authorize it/create that account like in HW6
  - Can also save user information/profile and retrieve it from the Firebase database
    - For example, the welcome loading page shows that user's name they signed up with.
    - In the future, this will be how we store the user's game data as well
  - Welcome Loading screen
