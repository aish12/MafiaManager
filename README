  - Login/Register page and functionality
    - You can log in and register and it will authorize it/create that account like in HW6
  - Can also save user information/profile and retrieve it from the Firebase database
    - For example, the welcome loading page shows that user's name they signed up with.
    - In the future, this will be how we store the user's game data as well
  - Welcome Loading screen

  - Deck creation views
    - When a user creates a new deck, they will be asked to select an image, create a name, and write a description for a deck
    - They will then be taken to the deck screen where they can create new cards. 
  - Card creation views
    - A user has 2 options when they choose to create a card, copy an existing set of cards or create a new one
    - The copy option will allow a user to multi select cards to copy
    - The new card option will ask the user to select an image, create a name, and write a des+ription of the card
    - This shows up as an alert. the code to complete this is in our project, however it is not yet properly linked to the collection view cell

  - Game views and Dashboard
  - Settings view	

Differences:
 - In our proposal we had a slight contradiction, saying that we would work on the statistics page during Alpha, but also that stats/history is a stretch goal
   We decided to keep it as a stretch goal hopefully as part of the final release (as clarified in our design doc)

 
 
Clarifications:
 - While there is a log in functionality, there is no log out functionality because in our Proposal we stated that is part of our settings page functionality.
 - In our design doc, we forgot to include a section for game instructions. To account for this we put this as part of the settings
